## Applied Math for Game 1
Began the day by testing to see if everyone has access to the Teams that Kyle had added us all to.
Then proceeded to review the challenge we had all worked on in the previous week.

### KittyKata
Lorenzo was the first person to showcase his code.

Implemented a different type of boolean return function that I've yet to see, which allows the user to create smaller lines of code  
Not as legible for those who haven't seen code before  
  
Zach was the second to do so.

If/Else statements that are easy to read  

### A Year that Leaps  
Alex and Angel showcased their codes

https://editor.p5js.org/agamis/sketches/80fnRFesa  
Both had similar If/Else statements that were fairly easy to understand  

### Will You Won't You  
Olivier and Lorenzo showcased their codes for this part.  
Lorenzo had a similar implementation to their previous showcase with the boolean functions  
whilst Olivier had a implementation that involved if/else statements
