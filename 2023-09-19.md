## Game Studio 1 
Matt was unfortunately unable to make it to our class today, thus the class was setup as a work period and meeting
typa deal with all the students discussing their games and what not. 
Unfortunately for me, the moment I read that message I fell back asleep and was unable to be there for the class session.

## Programming 1 
We got an introduction to Object-Orientated Programming today. It was a refresher for me as I have taken a class focused on Object-Orientated Programming (OOP).

Afterwards, I attempted to learn how to create arrays and numbers. Utilizing arrays, I was able to create a "container" for the number of NPCs I have spawned. By checking if the spot in the array is equal to null, I can choose to spawn a new NPC. Then once the array was filled up, the script would start to delete each entry starting from the first one in.

The next plan of action would be to randomly check a spot in the array to see if it contains an NPC or not, and if it doesn't, spawn a new NPC. By doing so, I can introduce an RNG feature that will, if youre  lucky, never spawn more than 5 enemies as it will keep checking the same numbers. Or create an even harder experience as it spawns all the waay to the cap by pure chance.
