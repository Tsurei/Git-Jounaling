## Game Studio 1 
Matt was unfortunately unable to make it to our class today, thus the class was setup as a work period and meeting
typa deal with all the students discussing their games and what not. 
Unfortunately for me, the moment I read that message I fell back asleep and was unable to be there for the class session.

## Programming 1 
We got an introduction to Object-Orientated Programming today. It was a refresher for me as I have taken a class focused on Object-Orientated Programming (OOP).

Afterwards, I attempted to learn how to create arrays and numbers.
