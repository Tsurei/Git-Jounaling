## Game Studio 1 
Started the day off with Game Studio w/ Dylan. Dylan showcased how he prototypes an idea/concept by drawing out his plan on a piece of paper
and then taking a picture of that plan and bringing it onto unity.

Began implementing the NPC spawner I had planned for the day before. Ran into some issues regarding the NPC prefab having a mistype pointer towards the "Player". However after a few attempts I was able to solve this issue by changing the variable from setting it manually in the Unity UI to automatically looking for a GameObject with the name "Player".

The next plan of action would be creating different NPCs that all have distinct movements and projectiles and what not. The current NPC I have has a culmination of most of the various features that will be used for other NPCs.

## Development and Narrative Design 1 
Chris started off with a lecture regarding narrative design. Going through what the flow zone is when it came to movies and games and how maintaining a good balacne between player skill and a difficulty helps keep the player tuned into their game. Too much of one, will lead players at various skill levels to feel bored or to stressed to play
