Started off the day rough, learning that someone close to me was in the hospital so I took time the time to be absent from my programming class today in order to visit them.
Hopefully they get better soon.

## Plans 
My plans for the day included a daily shift at UPS and then a volleyball league game right afterwards. Today would be our first game as a team, and as we have only had one practice as
a team so far, I am a bit skeptical about how we will perform during the game. 

Once I get home, I plan on creating a new Unity project for my Programming 1 assignment so it is much cleaner, as the current project file it is residing within is
messy and contains numerous amount of other files.
